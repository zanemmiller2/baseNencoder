NAME
      baseNencode -- encode and decode data in different base schemes

SYNOPSIS
      baseNencode [OPTION]...[FILE] 

DESCRIPTION
      The baseNencode function encodes and decodes between ASCII and a provided base system. 

      With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

      -n base
            encode input in the provided base system
      -d base
            decode input in provided base to ASCII
      -h
            print this manual page
  
CAVEATS
      baseNencode supports ASICC <--> Base conversions for Base16, Base32, Base58, Base64, and Basez85 systems. 
      For Base58, the input is limited to 256 bytes of ASCII input for memory and time performance, and limited 
      applications for Base58 encoding/decoding beyond 256 bytes.
